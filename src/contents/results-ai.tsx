            <p className="mb-4">
              Based on this design strategy, we developed the PBS platform to achieve high‚Äêthroughput screening of enzyme mutations with high adaptability. The software framework can be divided into four operational modules, organized in a hierarchical structure from top to bottom, consisting of an amino acid mutation module, a protein-substrate docking module, a molecular dynamics simulation module, and an evaluation analysis module.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Specifically, structural snapshots of the pre-reactive state are extracted from classical MD simulations and subjected to large-scale QM/MM optimization (Figure 1a). Transition-state structural features are then employed to define initial constraints in MD simulations, which are progressively relaxed to examine how amino acid mutations and substrate variations influence pre-reactive state stability. This strategy aims to construct catalytically active conformations-those that significantly lower activation energy and stabilize transition states-to capture the energetic determinants underlying substrate recognition and specificity. These parameters are derived from established organic reaction stereoelectronic principles, ensuring robust physical interpretability (Figure 1b). Once geometric definitions are applied to MD trajectories, PBS calculates the proportion of catalytically ready states within the ensemble. This approach bypasses the need for computationally intensive QM/MM free-energy mapping while still preserving mechanistic interpretability. Moreover, integration with PBS analysis allows estimation of the effect of sequence mutations, ligand modifications, or material design changes on catalytic readiness.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Enzymatic depolymerization of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has received considerable attention for closed-loop polyester recycling. A homogeneity study under industrial conditions reveals that LCC-ICCG outperforms the other the best-performing reported PET hydrolases (FAST-PETase, HotPETase), suggesting a path to scale-up. However, understanding of their PET-degrading activity and influencing factors remains incomplete, impeding the development of uniform approaches for enhancing PET hydrolases for industrial applications.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              To probe the origin of the enhanced catalytic efficiency of LCC-ICCG, we carried out MD simulations and DFT calculations. In enzyme-catalyzed acylation, proper orientation and proximity of catalytic residues are critical. The PBS, defined by a nucleophilic attack angle of 100‚Äì110¬∞ and a d(C‚ÄìOŒ≥) distance &lt;3.5 √Ö, was used as a metric. LCC-ICCG exhibited a markedly higher PBS population (37.3%) with angles tightly clustered within the optimal range (Figure 3a), compared to FAST-PETase (11.3%) and HotPETase (8.2%) (Figure 3b, c). This indicates more favorable HOMO‚ÄìLUMO alignment for nucleophilic attack. IGMH analysis further revealed stronger noncovalent interactions in LCC-ICCG, particularly between V212 and the ester bond (Figure 3d‚Äìf). In the catalytic triad, LCC-ICCG formed bifurcated hydrogen bonds between H242 and D237 (~2.9 and ~3.0 √Ö), whereas FAST-PETase and HotPETase maintained only a single H-bond (Figure 3g). QTAIM analysis showed bond strengths of ‚Äì5.6 kcal/mol for LCC-ICCG, significantly stronger than those in FAST-PETase and HotPETase (‚Äì1.8 and ‚Äì2.1 kcal/mol). These stronger H-bonds enhance proton transfer, thereby promoting acylation.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Additionally, a C‚ÄìH¬∑¬∑¬∑O interaction between V212 and the ester's non-carbonyl oxygen, absent in the other enzymes due to steric hindrance from I208, further stabilizes the PBS. V212 also forms an N‚ÄìH¬∑¬∑¬∑O bond (~3.1 √Ö) with D207, stabilizing the H237‚ÄìD206 interaction and increasing D206 basicity, which lowers the acylation barrier. Finally, QTAIM revealed key BCPs involving V212, D210, and W190 that stabilize the catalytic triad and modulate the flexibility of W190, crucial for substrate binding and product release (Figure 3i).

              Here, we applied an extensive cluster model to examine the acylation step of engineered PET hydrolases. Representative conformations from MD trajectories were used for QM calculations, and the optimized transition states are shown in Figure 4a‚Äìc. In all cases, Ser was deprotonated by His, enabling nucleophilic attack on the ester carbonyl to form the first tetrahedral intermediate. The calculated C‚ÄìOŒ≥ distances in the TSs were 1.97 √Ö (LCC-ICCG), 2.04 √Ö (HotPETase), and 2.02 √Ö (FAST-PETase). The corresponding barriers were 15.5, 19.3, and 20.4 kcal/mol, respectively, with the LCC-ICCG value aligning well with experimental kinetics (kcat = 0.7-4.8 s‚Åª¬π; 13.5-18.0 kcal/mol, Eyring equation).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              DIAS analysis further revealed that the lower barrier in LCC-ICCG stems from reduced distortion penalties, enhanced orbital overlap, and more favorable noncovalent interactions. In particular, dispersion contributions (-6.5 kcal/mol) and lower ŒîE<sup>strain</sup> account for the stabilized tetrahedral intermediate (Figure 4d). These results highlight the role of active-site preorganization in lowering activation energies and accelerating PET depolymerization.

              Multiscale QM/MM calculations were carried out to elucidate the catalytic mechanism and to validate the associated energy landscape. FAST-PETase, LCC-ICCG, and HiC were chosen as representative enzymes. The computational results unambiguously demonstrated that PET degradation proceeds via acylation and deacylation stages, irrespective of whether Si-face or Re-face binding is involved. Each of these stages can be further resolved into two concerted elementary steps. Notably, the Boltzmann-weighted average barrier of step ii for Re-face attack in FAST-PETase (33.1 kcal/mol) and LCC-ICCG (28.2 kcal/mol) is considerably high, indicating that this pathway is unlikely to occur during enzymatic PET degradation (Figure 5). In contrast, the Re-face attack in HiC exhibits a distinct behavior, with a markedly lower Boltzmann-weighted average barrier for step ii (20.2 kcal/mol), suggesting a more feasible reaction pathway compared with FAST-PETase and LCC-ICCG.

            <p className="mb-4">
              We reveal that both of the enzymes involve four elementary steps: (i) Ser-His-Asp-initiated nucleophilic attack, (ii) C-O bond cleavage, (iii) nucleophilic attack by water molecules, and (iv) IsPETase/ IsMHETase deacylation. Statistical results from 20 independent conformations highlight that step (i) and (iv) are competitive for determining the turnover rate while step (iv) is the rate-determining step. With the newly developed strategy, possible features (bonds, angles, dihedral angles, and charges) that influence the enzymatic catalysis were screened and identified. Robust relationship between active site features and activation energies were established. Distortion-interaction, hydrogen network, and noncovalent interaction analysis highlight the roles of distortion/interaction energy, hydrogen network, and weak interactions in the enzymatyic -catalyzed cascade degradation of PET.

            <p className="mb-4">
              To elucidate the origin of prochiral selectivity, we systematically investigated the effects of structural parameters, charge distribution, and intrinsic electric fields on the reaction energy barrier. From a structural perspective, we identified a consistent trend in the variation of key distances, angles, and dihedral angles along the reaction pathways, which is broadly conserved among the three enzymes examined (Figure 6). Nevertheless, distinct differences were also observed. For example, in Re-face binding of HiC, the PET@C1‚ÄìSer@O1 (3.5 ¬± 0.3 √Ö) and His@N1‚ÄìSer@H1 (1.9 ¬± 0.1 √Ö) distances were markedly longer than those in FAST-PETase (2.5 ¬± 0.1 and 1.7 ¬± 0.0 √Ö, respectively) and LCC-ICCG (2.7 ¬± 0.2 and 1.7 ¬± 0.1 √Ö, respectively). Moreover, during acylation, the hydrogen bonds in the oxyanion hole (PET@O4‚ÄìSer@H6 and PET@O4‚ÄìGln@H7) were significantly elongated in HiC, indicating weaker stabilization.

              Further correlation analysis revealed that, for both FAST-PETase and LCC-ICCG, the PET@O2‚ÄìHis@N1 distance and the PET@O2‚ÄìHis@N1‚ÄìSer@H1 angle exhibited strong linear relationships with the reaction energy barriers (R¬≤ = 0.87 and 0.90 for FAST-PETase; R¬≤ = 0.92 and 0.89 for LCC-ICCG, respectively) (Figure 6b, c). These findings suggest that longer PET@O2‚ÄìHis@N1 distances and smaller PET@O2‚ÄìHis@N1‚ÄìSer@H1 angles are critical determinants of prochiral selectivity in these two enzymes (Figure 6d).

              In contrast, HiC displayed poor correlation (R¬≤ = 0.03 and 0.36, respectively), and the coefficients of determination decreased markedly when including HiC in the analysis (e.g., PET@O2‚ÄìHis@N1 dropped from 0.76 to 0.46; PET@O2‚ÄìHis@N1‚ÄìSer@H1 dropped from 0.65 to 0.20). For HiC, the key determinants of prochiral selectivity instead involve the PET@O4‚ÄìGln@H7 and PET@C1‚ÄìSer@O1 distances. These results highlight that the weaker substrate binding and reduced oxyanion hole stability in HiC account for its lower activity in Re-face binding (Figure 6e).

              The changes of key structural and charge parameters during the whole catalytic process were systematically analyzed. As shown in, panels a‚àºc depict the charges of atoms PET@C1, PET@O4 and His@N1. Charge fluctuations of these three atoms are consistent with previous studies, with a consistent pattern of fluctuations. Charge of PET@C1 exhibit a "M" type fluctuation and the highest charge was found in the tetrahedral intermediate IM3 and IM8. Meanwhile, a "W"-shaped fluctuation was found for charge PET@O4, which indicate a dynamic charge transfer between the carbonyl carbon and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/carbonyl-oxygen">carbonyl oxygen</a>. This fluctuation of PET@O4 is related to the alterations in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/hydrogen-bonding">hydrogen bonding</a> networks D<sub>Tyr@H6-PET@O4</sub> and D<sub>Met@H7-PET@O4</sub>: the shorter the distance between D<sub>Tyr@H6-PET@O4</sub> and D<sub>Met@H7-PET@O4</sub>, the more negative charge PET@O4 carries. Indeed, the shortest distance between PET@O4 and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/hydrogen-atom">hydrogen atoms</a> is observed in the IM3 and IM8 intermediates. This indicates that the stabilizing effect of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/oxygen-ion">oxygen ion</a> cavities on the transition state is stronger. Charge of His@N1 exhibits a similar fluctuation trend to that of PET@O4, however, His@H4 and Asp@O5 exhibit a distinctive "W"-shaped fluctuation curve throughout the reaction process, thereby revealing the subtle alterations occurring between these two atoms. In particular, during the deacylation phase of the reaction, in which water molecules are involved, the fluctuation range of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/hydrogen-bonding">hydrogen bonding</a> in different conformations during the same period is approximately 0.3‚Äâ√Ö. Notably, we also detected a conformation with a probability of 5% during the IM8 period, in which the proton is transferred to Asp175. This further enriches our understanding of the mechanism of this reaction.
